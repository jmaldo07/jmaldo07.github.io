## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 6, Part 2

In the second part of Lab 6 was one of the more interesting and memorable sections of a lab. The main reason is my personal interest in the subject, coding mixed with gambling. I always wanted to make an “Odds” program for different card games, so this lab for blackjack was a good showing on how I can bring the basics to the program. The lab did help in being comfortable with if conditions and understanding the usage of &&.

* Lab 9

This lab was probably my favorite if not second favorite because it incorporated a lot of lessons and examples from the lectures by Mr. Moran. As much as I do like games, part 2 was not my favorite part of this lab, it was part 1 the spelling checker. Part 1 showed me a lot in the properties of ifstream and ofstream and how the program interacts with a file.

* Lab 8, Part 2

I know this part of the lab is kind of short and underwhelming because it is just showing a pattern but this has implications of a lot of things. Like text art, games, mazes, etc., but the main reason why I liked this lab is actually because the usage of nested for loops and trying to understand how the code works with barely knowing nested loops that well.
